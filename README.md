# Lesson Scheduler

A web-based lesson scheduler developed with Java Spring MVC, Maven, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. This application is designed to manage lessons, student balances, and teacher availability in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

## Features

### Teacher Features:
- **Manage Students**: Create, edit, and view students, including their balance and lesson history.
- **Lesson Management**: Create, edit, and approve lessons. Select students from a list and automatically fill in lesson details.
- **Availability Management**: Set unavailable times for each teacher.
- **View Calendar**: A landscape-oriented calendar that displays all lessons. You can also approve or edit lessons directly from the calendar.
- **Lesson Payments**: Studentsâ€™ balances are updated with a portion of their tuition fee after each lesson. Future updates will integrate payment systems for digital transactions (e.g., Stax API).

### Student Features:
- **View Lessons**: Students can only view their lessons and balance. They cannot see other students' lessons.
- **Request Lessons**: Students can request lessons from available teachers.

### Admin Features:

### Upcoming Features:

- **Calendar Improvements**: Lessons will be displayed with heights proportional to their duration for better visual clarity. 

### Other Features:
